Precisely, Hurdle lab is an oral test with around 4-6 questions. There are some samples below:

1. What is Concurrency? 
2. What is Mutex? Critical regions? Interleaved?
3. What are the language features you want a concurrent language can offer?
4. What will happen if data is unprotected?
5. What is a semaphore?
6. What does a delay statement indeed do in the concurrent environment?
7. What are the differences among function, entry and procedure in Ada?
8. What happened in your Lab 4 Philosopher Problem?

These questions are really simple as you can see, but **precise** answers should be provided to get a higher mark.
